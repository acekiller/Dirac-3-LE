DIRAC FMOD Example
==================

This example demonstrates how to use Dirac core with FMOD.

To use it we recommend you duplicate the dsp_custom FMOD example and change it to use our main.cpp from this folder. Also, make sure you add the Dirac library to the project and copy over the local_media folder. 

On the Mac, make sure you also add the Accelerate.framework to the project or you will get link errors.

On the Mac you can find the FMOD example projects in

	<SDK PATH>/FMOD Programmers API/examples

On Windows this will be in

	Programme\FMOD SoundSystem\FMOD Programmers API Windows\examples

Compile and run the demo project as you would any of the built-in FMOD examples.
